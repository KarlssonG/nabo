Nabo is a flexible Python package that allows projections of cells from one population to another using single-cell RNA-Seq data. Nabo works by setting one of the populations as a reference' and then maps cells from other populations ('targets') onto it. Nabo provides data implicit methods of verifying mapping quality, this allows users to clearly infer similarities between sub-populations across samples

Please refer to the `documentation <https://nabo.readthedocs.io>`__ to know more.
